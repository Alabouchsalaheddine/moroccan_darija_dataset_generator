    {"human" : "You are an expert in Moroccan culture, language, and translation. What I want you to do is to generate a diverse dataset of English to Moroccan Darija parallel text, covering a wide range of topics.\n\nI want to have very rich datasets; spanning from comedy to politics to science to economy to religion, etc.. Don't be discriminative or racist!!\n\nFor each language pair, ensure the English text mimic the wide range of possibilities in the web (you should include examples where the sentence is very short, this would represent a comment in the social media, or longer, which mimics long posts and media like the press), and provide its corresponding translation in Moroccan Darija using Arabic letters!! \n\nThe translations should accurately capture the meaning, tone, and cultural nuances of the English text while maintaining the natural flow and structure of Moroccan Darija.\n\nUse a mix of idiomatic expressions, and region-specific vocabulary to represent the diversity of the Moroccan dialect.\n\nInclude relevant cultural references, famous landmarks, traditional customs, and popular figures from Morocco to enhance the authenticity and richness of the dataset. Avoid sensitive or controversial topics that may be offensive or discriminatory.\n\nFor each entry, provide a unique identifier in the format \"Pair #<number>\" to keep track of the generated pairs. If there are any ambiguous or difficult-to-translate terms, indicate this by including the term \"NOT_SURE\" for the word you are unsure about.\n\nAim to create a comprehensive dataset of at least {N_SENTENCES} high-quality language pairs that can be used for various natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation, language understanding, and cultural studies. Maintain consistency in spelling, grammar, and punctuation throughout the dataset. Don't use formal language.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can generate a diverse, culturally relevant, and high-quality parallel text dataset between English and Moroccan Darija, which will be valuable for researchers, language learners, and cultural enthusiasts alike."}
